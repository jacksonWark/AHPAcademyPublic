					<h2 class="major">INDIVIDUALIZED SKILL DEVELOPMENT</h2>
					<p>
						We take a long-term development approach to each athlete. <br>
						This means their training is tailored to their specific needs and goals. <br><br>
						The best way to describe our philosophy and model is they are going to receive 1-on-1 coaching in a group environment. <br>
						We believe strongly in prioritizing the development of the skills that actually translate to being better on the field: throwing the ball harder, swinging the bat faster, and running faster. <br>
						Improving these three qualities, coupled with an <b>equal emphasis</b> on the fundamental skills of hitting, fielding, and throwing will allow each player to actually improve in a tangible, quantifiable way that will be apparent the next time they step on the field.

					<blockquote>
						“Deciding to work with Taylor and the Jr. Prospects was the best decision I ever made as a young ball player. 
						Growing up in a small town with little competitive baseball, I lacked the fundamental skills that were required to play at a higher level. 
						Taylor not only gave me skills to help make the Sr. Academy team, but also to move on and play college baseball. 
						His dedication to his players does not stop at the ball field. 
						Taylor goes above and beyond to help his players with whatever they may need. 
						Taylor not only made me into a better ball player, he taught me to be a better teammate and overall person. 
						Without Taylor’s guidance, I would not be the person I am today and I am forever grateful for what he has done for me.”
