					<h1 class="major"> AHP FOOTBALL PERFORMANCE</h1>
					<p>
						This program is for the serious football athlete only, who is looking to play 
						at the next level. Our mission is simple: to not only move our players on to junior, college and/or
						professional football, but to prepare them to succeed once they get there.
					</p>
					<p>
						We strive to leave no stone unturned in providing an integrated, holistic approach to developing the football athlete.

					<h2 class="major">INDIVIDUALIZED SKILL DEVELOPMENT</h2>
					<p>
						The AHP Program is unique in that we will put what is best for each individual player’s development first. 
						This may mean maximizing skill work, or it may mean prioritizing the weight room and/or speed development more – as just one example. 
						Each athlete will receive a highly detailed and intensive plan tailored to their specific needs and long-term plan.

					<p>
						We believe in taking ownership of the recruiting process. 
						We offer guidance and mentorship on both the football and academic side.<br> <br>
						We like to tell our athletes it’s their responsibility to develop their game, and it’s ours to get their video in front of as many college coaches as possible.

					<h2 class="major">STRENGTH & CONDITIONING</h2>
					<p>
						AHP is incredibly unique in our approach to training.<br> <br>
						It all starts with a thorough assessment process. From there, every aspect of the training program is individualized:
						warm-ups, lifts, speed and agility work, and mobility training.<br> <br>
						Additionally, athletes will be coached on nutrition strategies and have access to cutting-edge recovery modalities such as MarcPro, and Gladiator.
