					<p>
						This program is for the aspiring baseball athlete who is looking to improve their game and become the <b>best possible player they can be</b>. <br><br>
						This program is for <b>players 18 and under</b>.

					<h2 class="major">INDIVIDUALIZED SKILL DEVELOPMENT</h2>
					<p> We take a <b>long-term</b> development approach to each athlete. This means their training is <b>tailored to their specific needs and goals</b>. The best way to describe our philosophy and model is they are going to receive <b>1-on-1 coaching in a group environment</b>.</p>
					<p> We believe strongly in prioritizing the development of the skills that <b>actually translate to being better on the field</b>: throwing the ball harder, swinging the bat faster, and running faster. </p>
					<p> Improving these three qualities, coupled with an <b>equal emphasis</b> on the fundamental skills of hitting, fielding, and throwing will allow each player to actually improve in a <b>tangible, quantifiable way that will be apparent the next time they step on the field</b>. </p>

					<p>
						AHP is incredibly unique in our approach to training.<br> <br>
						It all starts with a <b>thorough assessment process</b>. <br> <br>
						From there, every aspect of the training program is individualized – <b>from the athlete’s warm-ups to their lifts, to their arm care routine, to their speed and agility training</b>.<br> <br>
						Additionally, athletes will be coached on <b>nutrition strategies</b>.
